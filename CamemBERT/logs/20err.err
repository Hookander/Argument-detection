Some weights of CamembertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at camembert/camembert-large and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

For this reason, `logger=True` will use `CSVLogger` as the default logger, unless the `tensorboard` or `tensorboardX` packages are found. Please `pip install lightning[extra]` or one of them to enable TensorBoard support by default
You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB MIG 2g.20gb') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision
